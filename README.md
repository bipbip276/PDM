# PDM, my Personnal Data Manager

Personal Data Manager (PDM) is a personal digital vault to keep your files private, intact and accessible.

PDM allows you to host all your personnal data to keep your files in a single standard folder located on the server. Files can be added by drag-and-drop, 'shared' from a mobile device), uploaded over FTP, etc... depending on your server configuration. Uploaded files can then be viewed, edited, archived or set as reminders.

## Install, Customize, Develop

To install PDM: Download, uncompress, copy onto a linux + http/php server.

System configuration is done by editing directly the server file (php) and the client file (html/javascript). Plugins can be added/removed/modified to give the user server-level functionnalities (backup, password management, share from mobile devices, etc...).

## Author & License

I started developping this software to improve my own digital hygiene. After using it for months, I realised that it could also help others. For this reason I decided to publish the code. The code and user experience is based on the ‘KISS’ philosophy - it is design for absolute minimum maintenance and maximum robustness. (contact me)
